                                NOW OBSOLETE

This project is part of the course "Sécurité des systèmes d'informations" (Security of Information Technologies), delivered at Telecom ParisTech (Paris, France) and lead by Jean Le Neutre.

As an exam, we are supposed to achieve a project, and we decided to program an Android Malware.
